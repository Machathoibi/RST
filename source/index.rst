Welcome to Storage's documentation!
===================================

Concept
---------------------
Virtualization reconfigures the relationship between a physical tape drive, storage media, and the application that reads and writes data. The TS7700 Cache uses disk drive modules (DDMs) as storage media and the TS7700 Server emulates the function and operation of IBMÂ® 3490 Enhanced Capacity (3490E) tape drives. These emulated tape drives are called virtual tape drives, and to an attached host they appear identical to physical tape drives.

Following are the operations available:

* Virtual device operation
* Volume tape formatting
