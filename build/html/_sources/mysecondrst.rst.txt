Data that is written or read through a virtual tape drive resides in a virtual volume on the DDMs in the TS7700 Cache. To a host application, a virtual volume shows the same characteristics as a physical tape volume. The size of virtual volumes is dependent upon the size of data received from the host; virtual volumes are only as large as necessary to hold the host data. This characteristic of virtual volumes increases the efficiency of layered storage and permits physical tape volumes to maximize available storage.
