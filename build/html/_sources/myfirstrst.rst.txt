Object store
============

Overview
--------

**Object policies** are used to determine how to manage objects that go to TS7700 from an external host, such as a DS8000 as part of transparent cloud tiering (TCT).
TS7700 currently allows the capability to set up copy policies for object redundancy across a TS7700 grid.
